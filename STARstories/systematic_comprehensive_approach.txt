S: I had always wanted to experience living and working in China. 
T: I knew that China is a very different culture, and I couldn't go there unprepared. 
A: Therefore I used a comprehensive approach in that I began a systematic study of China: the language, its history and culture. I also prepared for working in China. To be effective in working in China, I took a Cambridge English Language Teaching to Adults course, because that course helps you teach English without the need to know Mandarin.
R: I softened the culture shock significantly both for me and for my family.
