Values (top ~)

Q: What are your top values?
A: My top 3 values are:

achievement: attaining mastery of a field, self-advancement, growth.

coworkers: contact with colleagues that promotes a sense of belonging.

creativity and self-expression: working in a job in which I use my imagination to find new ways to do/say something.

Q: Could you illustrate?
A: When I came to Calvary Chapel, I saw that the work of the department was barely going. I saw the need to expand the staff and the services. I recruited 15 people, organized them in groups, and started creating a new curriculum. In a matter of months the attendance more than doubled. 
When I was working at Calvary Chapel there was a situation when I saw I needed to start delegating duties to other team members. I saw one fellow that knew how to do it, but I wasn't sure he would do it the right way. If I allowed him, I would probabpy cause a mistake. But I went ahead and allowed him and the people liked the variety that resulted. 

When I was working at CC, I saw the need to organize another department. I saw the interest in kids and organized a new department. I saw that to be successful we had to do some serious training. I knew that it was not necessary to go that serious, but I did it anyway. As a result the attendance of the group grew within several weeks.
