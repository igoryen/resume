Purposefulness (ability to get the job done, see through to the end). 

S: When our first child was born, I wanted to raise him bilingual. The task was to speak English with him every day, while my wife would speak Russian.
T: One day I woke up and realized that I couldn't go on any more because I felt I was depriving my child of normal father. 
A: I decided to keep trying even though it felt unnatural.
R: As a result today, after 14 years, my both children are fluent in English and do not require ESL classes.
