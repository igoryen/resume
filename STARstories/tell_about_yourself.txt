Tell us about yourself?
I worked as a teacher for the first decade of my life. I got to the top of the language teaching profession and saw that I really had nowhere else to go.
Steve Jobs said "Stay hungry. Stay foolish". I looked around and saw that I had always been "hungry" for computers. I felt very foolish but I was hungry. I am learning, and the more I learn the more I know that I know nothing. I am still foolish and I am still hungry. That's what making me go forward.
