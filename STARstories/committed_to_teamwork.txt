Committed to teamwork. 
S: During my tenure in the Calvary Chapel Church, as I was in charge of the children Sunday school I saw that to be effective in our highly demanding work with chilqdren of different ages we needed several teams so that they could rotate. I had organized young people into 4 teams and supplied them with teaching materials. Each team was engaged once a month. ----- I also organized the young people who wished to be in the drama team in 3 teams who also rotated. --- I always believed in encouraging volunteers and allow them to fulfill themselves and be busy in church and keep them off the street. ---- Each lesson included a song and one day a young guy on one of the teams thought up a song. Another part of the lesson was a craft which the team members often designed themselves. They also took initiative in preparing puppet shows.
