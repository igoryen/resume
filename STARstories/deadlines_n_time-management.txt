Deadlines and time management.
I try to get the complete picture of the project. make a list of components that must be done, their difficulty levels, time/resources needed to complete each component. Divide the time to deadline and divide it by the components to see whether it can be done within 40 hour week or longer. Make a schedule and leave a time cushion for trouble shooting and contingencies.
S: At CSS we had 2 months before a festival. 
T: to learn and master one drama
A: I divided the drama into components and dealt with each one 
R: We were ready on time.
